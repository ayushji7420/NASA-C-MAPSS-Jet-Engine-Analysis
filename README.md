# NASA CMAPSS Data Analysis
This is a simple project to analyze the NASA CMAPSS dataset and predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft engines. I did this to practice data preprocessing, EDA, and machine learning.

## 📁 Project Contents
Data: Raw and processed CMAPSS datasets.

Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling.

Scripts: Python code for cleaning data, training models, and plotting results.

## 📌 About the Dataset
The CMAPSS dataset has sensor data from multiple engines.  

Each engine runs until failure.  

The goal is to predict how many cycles an engine has left before it fails (RUL).

## ✅ What I Did
Loaded and cleaned the data.  

Did exploratory data analysis (EDA).  

Normalized the data using MinMaxScaler. 

Built a simple machine learning model to predict RUL.  

Evaluated the model performance.  


## 🛠️ Tools Used  

Python  

Pandas, NumPy  

Scikit-learn  

Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Results
### I plotted:

Sensor trends over time.  

Actual vs. predicted RUL.
